## Here comes the legalese....
By using the Fridge source code, you agree to the [LICENSE](https://github.com/CircuitCodes/FridgeBot/blob/master/README.md) and the following terms. By ignoring or failing these terms, you are in breach of the GNU GPL.

When hosting a self hosted version of Fridge, you agree that:

- Your modified source must be publicly available and linked in the bot; for example, as a response to an external cog.
- Your source repository must link back to the original repository. Another acceptable method of doing so is done by forking the original repository and leaving the "forked from" message intact.
- Your bot **cannot** be public. The "Public Bot" check mark on the bot application must be unchecked.
- You cannot charge for anything in your bot, or lock features behind "upvotes" or similar.
- You **cannot** list your bot on **any** bot-list services.
- No support will be given by CircuitRCAY, the author on modifications on the source code of the bot itself. Issues will be considered if the bug is reproducible on the original bot.

When hosting a cog, you agree that:

- Your cog source **must** be publicly available.
- Your cog is compatible with the bot, and has correct manifest values.
- Support will be given on cogs, unless you have modified source code of the bot itself, of which is needed to refer to the above section.
